# ![dowsify](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c18d5178-f9ce-451c-b212-34f7d5893959) Dowsify - Hidden Item Table Editor
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/491eeb01-5b26-4036-86e7-7b675a2ae8a0)


**Features**
- Edit the Hidden Item Table
- Patch to Standardize the table, so that the CommonScripts follow the same order.
Using this patch will change the items in a Vanilla rom, so if you don't plan on changing Hidden Item locations, don't patch.

**Instructions**
- Open an extracted ROM Contents Folder (DSPRE or VS Maker 2)
- You can select an item, quantity and the "Script Index". Script Index is how the game calls hidden item by CommonScript.

**Important**
- Currently only compatible with HeartGold (USA), SoulSilver (USA) and Platinum (USA) Version.
- Other versions implemented soon.
- Feature to extract ROM using this program will come soon.
