![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1eab08df-586b-43ea-9f61-fa9bb1f5f657)

**Features**
- Edit the Hidden Item Table
- Patch to Standardize the table, so that the CommonScripts follow the same order.
Using this patch will change the items in a Vanilla rom, so if you don't plan on changing Hidden Item locations, don't patch.

**Instructions**
- Open an extracted ROM Contents Folder (DSPRE or VS Maker 2)
- You can select an item, quantity and the "Script Index". Script Index is how the game calls hidden item by CommonScript.

**Important**
- Currently only compatible with HeartGold Version.
- Other versions implemented soon.
- Feature to extract ROM using this program will come soon.
